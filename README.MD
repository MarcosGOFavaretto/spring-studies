# Difference between Spring Framework and Boot.

The Spring Framework is a modular Java framework, which means that it is not necessary to use all of them classes, resources and dependencies, allowing us to use less computer resources.

The Spring Boot is one of the modules created for Spring Framework. It allow us to create Spring projects more easily, since the number of modules for Spring applications is very large.
